Osteopetrosis is a rare genetic disease that causes abnormally increased bone mass and density due to impaired bone-resorption and turnover (Coudert et al., 2015). This disease is both clinically and genetically heterogenous and it can be inherited through autosomal dominant/recessive or x-linked inheritance patterns (Povoroznyuk et al., 2021). It is important to note that the parents are unaffected and are known to be consanguineous meaning that they share a common ancestor, only the child is diagnosed with this disorder. Diagnosis is based on both radiography and genetic testing methods (R K et al., 2024).
In this study, the platform GALAXY will be used to make use of tools such as FreeBayes, DeepVarient and NaïveVarient calling to determine the differences in the exome sequencing data amongst the family trio. Through genetic testing and by using these tools, it should be possible to identify the variants that could potentially be the genetic cause of this child’s disease.
